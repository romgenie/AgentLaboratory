- TL;DR of the paper
- What are we trying to do and why is it relevant?
- Why is this hard?
- How do we solve it (i.e. our contribution!)
- How do we verify that we solved it (e.g. Experiments and results)
- This must only be a single paragraph, not more.

Please make sure the abstract reads smoothly and is well-motivated. This should be one continuous paragraph with no breaks between the lines.

- Longer version of the Abstract, i.e. of the entire paper
- What are we trying to do and why is it relevant?
- Why is this hard?
- How do we solve it (i.e. our contribution!)
- How do we verify that we solved it (e.g. Experiments and results)
- New trend: specifically list your contributions as bullet points
- Extra space? Future work!
""",
    "related work": """
- Academic siblings of our work, i.e. alternative attempts in literature at trying to solve the same problem.
- Goal is to “Compare and contrast” - how does their approach differ in either assumptions or method? If their method is applicable to our Problem Setting I expect a comparison in the experimental section. If not, there needs to be a clear statement why a given method is not applicable.
- Note: Just describing what another paper is doing is not enough. We need to compare and contrast.
""",
    "background": """
- Academic Ancestors of our work, i.e. all concepts and prior work that are required for understanding our method.
- Usually includes a subsection, Problem Setting, which formally introduces the problem setting and notation (Formalism) for our method. Highlights any specific assumptions that are made that are unusual.
- Make sure to use mathematical notation when necessary.
- Note: If our paper introduces a novel problem setting as part of its contributions, it's best to have a separate Section.
""",
    "methods": """
- What we do. Why we do it. All described using the general Formalism introduced in the Problem Setting and building on top of the concepts / foundations introduced in Background.
- Make sure you clearly report precise mathematical equations in the methods section and the precise methodology.
""",
    "experimental setup": """
- How do we test that our stuff works? Introduces a specific instantiation of the Problem Setting and specific implementation details of our Method for this Problem Setting.
- Do not imagine unknown hardware details.
- Includes a description of the dataset, evaluation metrics, important hyperparameters, and implementation details.
""",
    "results": """
- Shows the results of running Method on our problem described in Experimental Setup.
- Includes statements on hyperparameters and other potential issues of fairness.
- Only includes results that have actually been run and saved in the logs. Do not hallucinate results that don't exist.
- Make sure you clearly and numerically report experimental results in the results section.
- If results exist: compares to baselines and includes statistics and confidence intervals.
- If results exist: includes ablation studies to show that specific parts of the method are relevant.
- Discusses limitations of the method.
- Make sure to include all the results from the experiments, and include all relevant figures.
""",
    "discussion": """
- Brief recap of the entire paper.
- To keep going with the analogy, you can think of future work as (potential) academic offspring.
